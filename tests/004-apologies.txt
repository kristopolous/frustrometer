I'm sorry about that ... it's difficult to come up with a reliable test system
that uses so many moving parts. I'm running another run right now and I'll do
a visual inspection.  I'll attach it here.  

I was building a unit-test system previously and I'll go and see if I can 
finish that to avoid things like this in the future.
