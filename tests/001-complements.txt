It's been such a pleasure to do business with you in the past 6 months.  I'm
honored to be able to work with such an esteemed person.  I've read over all
of your previous emails pretty closely and I think I know where to go from
here.  I've prepared a proposal of what I'd like to do and I've attached it
here.  Please tell me if you have trouble opening it and we can go from there.

Thanks again and I hope to hear from you soon.
