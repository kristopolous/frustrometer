Well, that explains the sudden abandonment of ***.  I have to ask about the patent (and trademark) and what your intentions are with respect to said patent, they obviously felt you wouldn't openly license the patent.  I will not work on proprietary projects for free nor will I contribute to them any anyway without compensation.  I am late to the game here, but it really looks to me like you want to unfairly gain from their hard work.  Tell me how I am wrong?
