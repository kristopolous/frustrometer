I've been on large listservs since around 1990, and I was also a contributor to various usenet newsgroups for several years. I think there might be a culture difference at work here between the way Americans and Brits communicate. Americans are in general more polite than Brits (no I don't have any data to back this up. It's just my personal experience and opinion). Although most Brits in my experience are friendly, Americans pay more attention to the social niceties (even if they don't like you). Combining that with the culture of terseness of many technical listservs such ar r-help, and the tendency of some academics to not suffer fools gladly, can lead to an unpleasant experience for newbies. I tell my students NEVER to post a question to r-help without asking me first. I'm big enough to take the slings and arrows. They will probably get upset if they are shot to bits. I've come across many unpleasant academics in my time, as an undergrad, graduate student, postdoc, and now as an academic myself (Even I can be unpleasant on a bad day.). It's pretty common in the Australian and British systems. The best attitude is to not take it personally, thank the person for their excellent advice, and step back and marvel at the quality, quantity and intensity of the abuse!
