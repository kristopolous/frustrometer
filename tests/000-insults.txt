Ok, you are a real fucking moron. I mean clearly we went over all of
this before in previous emails.  I just don't know what to say.  I've
told you how to do this in every fucking way I can; over skype, over
the phone, through email ... I documented all the features and sent
them to you - the unit tests pass and everything looks good.  Why,
for the love of god, do you keep opening the identical bug over and 
over again, saying the same asinine shit. Are you that dense? Are you
just trying to troll the bug-tracker?  I really don't understand what
your MO is here.  I wake up, grab my coffee, and need to leave room in
the cup as I cry tears of sadness for the pain that your children must
endure in putting up with you as their parent.  This is utterly ridiculous.
