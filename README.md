frustrometer
============

A tool to help those without tact know when they may be coming across as an ass.

Here is an example of two ways of stating an issue.  In the first, a helpful temperature gauge has opened
up alerting us that the words we are using may not be the best choice.

Below, we've reworded the message in a more diplomatic way - thus pleasing the frustrometer and hopefully not
pissing off the recipient.
