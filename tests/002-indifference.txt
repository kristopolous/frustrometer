Alright, whatever you'd like to do here.  I really don't care what we're doing
either way.  If you'd rather implement it your way, then that's fine. I just
need a decision either way.  You need to give me some kind of direction for
moving forward on this thing.  I'm sick of reimplementing and reverting issues
on your behalf because you are so indecisive on simple things.
